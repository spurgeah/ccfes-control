example_mid_level.py and run2live4.py are fromdifferent python libraries used to control the hasomed P24 stimulator.
write a code to control the P24 that works with the commands from the example_mid_level.py library to create a code that does everything that run2live4.py does.
leave notes throughout the code explaining what each line does to a non-programmer



read and filter EMG
translate to FES command

figure shows
live EMG
live FES amplitude / reaction

add FES parameters to CSV file output


CCFES.py --
establish starting FES parameters
import tools and utility modules
import all device information
print device information
prompt file name to save to 
data will save to: 

-- main -- 
    find I24 COM port
    find P24 COM port

    input - press enter to start recording/stimming

    real time plotting of EMG channels
    real time monitor of FES channel parameters
        FES chord colors red;1,5 blue;2,6 black;3,7 white;4,8

    start thread - press enter to stop recording
    start thread press something to close EMG/FES windows

        data aquisition function --
        collect data
        loop until stop button is pressed
        while -live data-
            send threshold input to FES command application
            retrieve new FES values
            plot EMG data - append value
            add desired values to CSV file
                channels, delta time, time overall, FES parameters

        finally
            shut down EMG data stream
            stop FES
            stut down devices


start listening threads
run live plotting window(s)


Ask the user where to save the data and rename the file
